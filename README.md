# SubSync for Windows

Wouln't it be awesome if you had a tool that watches for your video files and automatically downloads their subtitles?

Imagine that, as soon as you download a new video, its subtitle could automagically appear along with it, in your preffered language. Cool, isn't it? TV shows, movies, documentaries, name it.

I present you SubSync, a free and open-source subtitle downloader tool!
